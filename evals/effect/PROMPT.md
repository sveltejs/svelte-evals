Create a Svelte 5 number doubler component that uses the `$effect` rune.

The component should have a number input starting at 5, use `$effect` to calculate the doubled value whenever the number changes, and include a button to increment the number.

Create the component in `src/routes/+page.svelte` without importing other components
