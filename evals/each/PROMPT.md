Create a Svelte 5 character list component that uses the `{#each}` block.

The component should display a hardcoded list of 3 Seinfeld characters (Jerry, Elaine, Kramer) and include a button to add George to the list.

Create the component in `src/routes/+page.svelte` without importing other components
